    "This is essentially a single python script that simulates the nervous system of the C. elegans; with many caveats known to the authors.  The goal is purposeful simplicity to be able to demonstrate the concepts surrounding simulating a nervous system with a reasonable amount of biological detail.  This walkthrough will explain the simple-C-elegans code and how it works.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A more robust approach is being taken in the OpenWorm project that involves many pieces of infrastructure that are more sophisticated, but also less simple.  Therefore, in addition to explaining how this code works, the larger OpenWorm infrastructure that is responsible for various steps will also be explained along the way."
